## Getting Started

Welcome in our project, we are a made a project library in java

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `src/Main` : the folder Main App
- `src/Function` : the folder to maintain function in app
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

<!-- > If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there. -->

<!-- ## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies). -->
